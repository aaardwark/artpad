# ArtPad

Draw on a large 'pad' using a mouse/trackpad. 
Colours can be chosen by selecting RGB values. 
Opacity and thickness controls are below the colour sliders. 
Undo and redo buttons are in the top right corner. 
Finished drawings can be downloaded as SVG files.

When the pen tool is selected and the cursor is over the pad (a large SVG element), dragging the cursor adds an SVG path to the pad.
